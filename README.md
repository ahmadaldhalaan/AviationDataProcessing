# Aviation Data Processing

We develop two big data pipelies using AWS for aviation data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The first pipline uses batch processing using Hadoop, while the second pipeline uses stream processing using Spark. Both pipelines produce similar analysis insights. We include two seperate reports for each pipeline.
